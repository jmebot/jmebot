- 👋 Hello World, I’m @jmebot
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and building relationships with other members so I can gain more knowledge in programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about python on the website https://www.codecademy.com 
        If you have any other recommendations, please let me know. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that people are needing help with, from a beginner developer level.
- If you are interested in collaborating or just giving me some advice/knowledge about beginning this journey, contact me through this or my email!
